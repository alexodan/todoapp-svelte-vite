# About the app

Just a silly todo app, trying to pick up some svelte for 2022(?).

The plan is doing:

- Some sort of "notes" webapp next adding a bit more of complexity
- ??? (haven't figured out yet but something with async or native state management?)
- A medium.com clone (probably guided by some standards found in https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)
- Profit.
